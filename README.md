### 📖 Description
This is a very basic component that implements a live "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) Markdown editor in React using the "tip-tap" JavaScript library.  

The point of this component is to create an editor that I can use to author blog posts in-browser, and more or less see exactly what the blog post will look like before sending the text data for the blog post to be stored on the backend in markdown format. The backend will send the markdown for a specific blog post upon user ask, and display it for website visitors in roughly the same way it is displayed in this WYSIWYG Editor.   

I am trying out various libraries for this task so I may have other repos with similar WYSIWYG Markdown React editor components available on my Github profile created with different libraries, depending on when you are reading this.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* _React_
* _JavaScript_
* _HTML_
* _sass_
* _eslint_
* _tiptap.js_
* _marked.js_
* _npm_
<br><br/>

### 🦠 Known Bugs OR Issues

1. Default styling is basic to ensure easier portability. For instance the the default selected button is not highlighted on page load. 
2. Default styling is made for desktop viewing rather than mobile
3. Default styling uses `.scss` (sass) files rather than `.css`, but no sass-specific syntax or features (mixins, etc) are used, so it should work fine just to rename the stylesheets with a `.css` filename if you don't want to install sass
3. State is not output anywhere, but this is highly dependent upon specific implementation details
